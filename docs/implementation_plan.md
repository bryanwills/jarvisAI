# Jarvis (Local AI) – Full Implementation Plan
Date: 2025-08-27


This bundle contains a complete, privacy-first plan to build your local “Jarvis” system using **RAG + LoRA**, running on your **ESXi R630** (for now) and later on a **Threadripper 9000 Pro + RTX 5090**. It aligns with your repos:
- https://github.com/bryanwills/jarvisAI
- Forked: https://github.com/bryanwills/jarvis-LLM-guy (upstream: https://github.com/llm-guy/jarvis)

It also integrates your tools (Cursor, Wakatime, Claude Desktop/CLI, ChatGPT API, n8n, AgentOS, SST/opencode), and sets you up for **faceless YouTube** automations.

Each numbered step below has its own detailed `.md` file in this bundle. Step **18** is *Cost & Growth*, per your request. A TL;DR execution plan is included as Step 21.

## Overview of the 21 Steps
1. Key Concepts & Choices (Training vs LoRA vs RAG)  
2. Hardware Plan & Storage Sizing  
3. Networking & DNS Baseline (Tailscale, reverse proxy, ports)  
4. Repos & Tooling (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, AgentOS, SST/opencode)  
5. Data Layer: Postgres + pgvector  
6. Embeddings Service (local)  
7. Ingestion Pipeline (files, GitHub, OCR)  
8. Activity Monitoring (ActivityWatch)  
9. RAG Indexes (LlamaIndex)  
10. Agents & Tools (LangChain/LangGraph)  
11. Inference (Ollama – dev)  
12. OpenWebUI (local chat UI)  
13. Second Brain / PKM (Markdown Vault + Sync + Notion mirror)  
14. n8n Automations (reminders, digests, MealForge workflows)  
15. Real-time Focus Coach (rules + notifications)  
16. vLLM on Threadripper + RTX 5090  
17. LoRA Fine-Tuning (Axolotl/Unsloth)  
18. Cost & Growth (start free → migrate)  
19. Image/Video Generation (StabilityMatrix/LykosAI)  
20. Security & Backups (VLAN, pg_dump, rclone→Supabase)  
21. TL;DR: Execution Checklist

## Agentic RAG (What & Why) – Short Answer
Agentic RAG lets an **agent** iteratively decide *what to retrieve next*, *how to use tools (search/indexes)*, and *when to stop*, instead of a single one-shot retrieval. It’s very useful once your knowledge grows: the agent can route among indexes (Notes vs Code), refine queries, call MealForge tools, and plan multi-step actions (e.g., “summarize day → log reminders → draft blog”). We enable this via **LangChain (LangGraph)** + **LlamaIndex** router query engines.

See *step-09.md* and *step-21.md* for concrete patterns, and **extras/agentic_rag.md** for more depth.
